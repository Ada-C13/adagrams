# Our first job is to build a hand of 10 letters for the user. To do so, add a method called draw_letters in adagrams.rb. This method should have the following properties:

#   No parameters
#   Returns an array of ten strings
  #   Each string should contain exactly one letter
  #   These represent the hand of letters that the player has drawn
#   The letters should be randomly drawn from a pool of letters
  #   This letter pool should reflect the distribution of letters as described in the table below
  #   There are only 2 available C letters, so draw_letters cannot ever return more than 2 Cs
  #   Since there are 12 Es but only 1 Z, it should be 12 times as likely for the user to draw an E as a Z
#   Invoking this method should not change the pool of letters (USING METHOD CALLED ARRAY.SAMPLE HERE)
  #   Imagine that the user returns their hand to the pool before drawing new letters

# Next, we need a way to check if an input word (a word a player submits) only uses characters that are contained within a collection (or hand) of drawn letters. Essentially, we need a way to check if the word is, indeed, an anagram of some or all of the given letters in the hand.

# To do so, add a method called uses_available_letters? in adagrams.rb. This method should have the following properties:

# Has two parameters:
    # input, the first parameter, describes some input word, and is a string
    # letters_in_hand, the second parameter, describes an array of drawn letters in a hand. You can expect this to be an array of ten strings, with each string representing a letter
# Returns either true or false
# Returns true if every letter in the input word is available (in the right quantities) in the letters_in_hand
# Returns false if not; if there is a letter in input that is not present in the letters_in_hand or has too much of compared to the letters_in_hand

# Each letter within word has a point value. The number of points of each letter is summed up to represent the total score of word
# Each letter's point value is described in the table below
