What are the components that make up a method? | The structure of a method is indicated by "def/return/end". The def contains the signature of the method that describes the action/purpose of the method with the parameters, or variables we are going to use inside our block of code that lives in the method. Need to be cognizant that the variable we define in the signature matches what is used in the block. The return allows you to exit the method and gives us the results. If a return is not indicated, then the return will be nil. To use the method, we need to invoke it by calling the method and supplying an argumnet for that particular parameter. |
What are the advantages of using git when collaboratively working on one code base? | Using git helped keep track of changes that either collaborator made. Instead of emailing files back and forth or cutting and pasting via Slack, the entire file lives in a safe house rather than locally where things are bound to happen. It is especially useful to be able to go back to previous versions that worked at the end of the night when the current morning version does not appear to be working. |
What kind of relationship did you and your pair have with the unit tests? | If speaking specifically to the waves of the project, we had a learning moment to make sure the tests were running at each wave. While the code was being written, being aware of the variable names was also important in developing the rest of the code. Additionally, since it was the first project, it was a "getting to know you, your style of tackling group work, and agreeing on the flow of how to carry out the project" which functioned well. Being open, respectful, and receptive of a partner's working style, personality, and understanding their guess vs ask tendancies helped to navigate this new journey. | 
Does your code use any methods from the `Enumerable` mixin? If so, where and why was it helpful? | Yes, we used .include? because it allowed us to supply a return true if the given string from the user's word contains the given characters in the list supplied. | 
What was one method you and your pair used to debug code? | We utilized the error messages provided in the terminal to track our errors. In the future, we would like to be more proficient in using the Debugger which would be useful in seeing what is happening in our data structures and loops. |
What are two discussion points that you and your pair discussed when giving/receiving feedback from each other that you would be willing to share? | We strongly agreed that reviewing the project in its entirety using the whiteboard to assist is critical. This would be an opportunity to ask questions and clarify any parts of the project. We have a deeper understanding of our work habits, feelings of not letting our partner down that would lead to overcompensating and taking away from the pair programming experience all together, and making good use of our TAs. |
